League of Legends World Championship Series takes place in a month. This app will track all the pros and organize their solo-queue stats in a way that will determine what champions they're practicing the most.

Maybe at Worlds, they may play the champions they've practiced with?

This is something I've always wanted to do. With the new found powers(Web Development) entrusted to me by [Viking Code School](www.vikingcodeschool.com), I decided to do it.
